# What did I learn?

- Cellular automata has lots of physics involved that is a really complex system that has tons of tiny components that work together to produce something amazing.

- A Cellular Automoton is a grid of cells ( 1 Dimensional, can also be 2D)

- A Cell gas a defined state. Each cell has a state (ex. black or white, 1 or 2, etc.) and are defined by neighbourhood of the surrounding cells

- A cell state is the state of the cell at any moment in time that is equal to the neighbourhood states of the surrounding cells.

- Works sort of like a pattern. You can design a set of rules that will determine what happens to each cell and more specifically, HOW they are affected by their neighbours.

# What do I stll not know?

- How was this invented? I would love to know the origin of cellular automata.

- How did all these rules (ex. The Rule 30) come to be? How were they created?


# What interesting ideas do I still have?

- Similarily to recursive art, I would like to work with js to come up with some cool type of art based on CA and rules for neigbours (i.e. branches and leaves on a tree)
